[ ] different minimum contrast for light and dark, also in config.ini
  [ ] minimum-contrast-light and minimum-contrast-dark priority, with fallback to minimum-contrast

[ ] iterative contrast increasor uses HSL instead of contrast gradient descent

[ ] exif load skips kmeans execution without making code ugly
  [x] main -> core.main() and then __main__ imports core.main ?

[ ] fix verbose color printing now that we don't generate 5 palettes

- ~~main -> __main__ and update symlink~~
- ~~exif only stores base and bold colors, re-derives 5-palette~~ this loses information about cluster-sorting of colors
[x] better config
  [x] fix fails on missing section
