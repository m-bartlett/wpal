[ ] zip-appify like pathpick

[ ] export wallpaper path to hook environment
  [ ] Image notification preview to show wallpaper set

[ ] different minimum contrast for light and dark, also in config.ini
  [ ] minimum-contrast-light and minimum-contrast-dark priority, with fallback to minimum-contrast

[ ] iterative contrast increasor uses HSL instead of contrast gradient descent

[ ] exif load skips kmeans execution without making code ugly

[ ] fix verbose color printing now that we don't generate 5 palettes

[ ] terminal preview frame fix

    -> run k-means with k=3 to get the most prominent 3 colors to use as a basis
    -> interpolate a helical/circular spline through the points in HSV space
    -> each discrete hue 0-360 has an intersection point with the curve
    -> determine which of the 6 primary colors the minimal set of hull points are closest to
    -> for remaining primary colors, pull the value of the curve that intersects their hue

- ~~main -> __main__ and update symlink~~
- ~~exif only stores base and bold colors, re-derives 5-palette~~ this loses information about cluster-sorting of colors
[x] main -> core.main() and then __main__ imports core.main ?
[x] better config
  [x] fix fails on missing section
